there's not much to do in calculations (except some code prettifying),
but plenty to do regarding visualization, and possibly comparission
of preeq data from multiple devices.

i just don't have time nor urgent need to reimplement my original and 
more advanced frontend js implementation to more civilized language
(perl, that is) and backend calculations.

but i hope to get back to it in some not-very-distant time.
on the other hand, this is something very few people need and know about,
and they who know are probably already using more sophisticated tools
to analyze preeq data, so no pressure on me
